# TODO list
Seriously... there's nothing done yet, so, everything's gotta be done.
This list will most likely grow exponentially in the first months.

## Things we cannot live without
* Bash syntax
* Syntax highliting
* Auto-correction
* Value prompt
* Command name completion
* Automatic suggestions
* Path completion
* Directory history/stack
* Willcard completion
* Command argument completion
* Colors
* Searchable command history
* Customization using web interface (hipsters) or configuration scripts (hippies)
* More features ([link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_command_shells))

## Features
* Easily extendability with javascript plugins
* Bash script compatibility within the command prompt

## Others
Pending categorization. Pretty much everything that comes on our mind.

* Stream redirections
* pushd / popd
