# TODO list
Seriously... there's nothing done yet, so, everything's gotta be done.
This list will most likely grow exponentially in the first months.

## Development
* Define an architecture for the source code
* Define code styling

## Things we cannot live without
* Tab completion
* Colors
* Customization using web interface (hipsters) or configuration scripts (hippies)

## Features
* Easily extendability with javascript plugins
* Bash script compatibility within the command prompt

## Others
Pending categorization. Pretty much everything that comes on our mind.

* /etc/motd
* Pipes
* pushd / popd
